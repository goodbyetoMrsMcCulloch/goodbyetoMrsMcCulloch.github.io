Skiing 2020
</h1><p><br/>
I went skiing in the February half term of 2020 and I really enjoyed it.<br/>It was so fun speeding down the slopes.<br/>You can find a couple of videos below. <br/>
At the ski resort I went to there was a train going literally up the mountain!.<br/>It used coggs on the bottom of the train to interlock with special track so the train didn't hurtle down the mountainout of controll.
<br/>
There was WiFi at lots of places so I could check my phone without paying Swiss roaming charges.<br/>
I used an app that told me how many lifts I'd taken and how far I had gone. It was really fun to be able to view all my skiing stats on the app.<br/>
